  <h3>|PHYS S-12|   Week 1: Introduction </h3> <br> 
        <h4> Day 1: Introduction to Materials and Documentation </h4>
            <p> This was the first day of the summer course. I was really excited to see other people who loved designing, engineering, etc. I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of people who were musicians and artists! At the same time, I was very nervous. </p>

        <h4> Day 2: Fusion 360 </h4>
            <p> For our class, we started working with Autodesk Fusion 360, a program for 3D design. I had worked with programs like these before in my school. Personally, I am more familiar with Autodesk Inventor, but Fusion 360 has pretty similar mechanics. It is still fun and good to use. 
        
        <h5> Components </h5>
            <p> Looking through the kit, I chose three objects that I wanted to design on Fusion 360. I chose one of the 3D printed pieces (white), one of the Lego Cylinders, and a small metal bearing.
