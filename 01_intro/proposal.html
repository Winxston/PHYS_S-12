	<h3> Proposal </h3>
	<p> At the moment, I have two final project ideas: </p> 

	<p> My first proposal is a window blind that can sense different amounts of light. When there isn't enough light outside, the window blinds close. The window blinds open, however, when there is enough light outside. This lets natural light inside the room. On the funny side, I got this idea from my mother. She used to constantly remind to let sunlight in because I would usually work in a dark room. </p>
