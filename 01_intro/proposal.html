	<h3> Proposal </h3>
	<p> At the moment, I have only one final project idea: </p> 

	<p> My proposal is light up slippers. It doesn't sound like anything fascinating, but I figured that creating something like this could really do senior citizens good. My grandparents, for example, have aged to a point where their vision is incredibly fuzzy. One time, my grandfather even mistakened my cousin for me! Anyway, I plan to create a pair of slippers where the user can insert his foot in. An LED light built in the slipper then lights up, like a flashlight to show the user what's in front of him/her. With this, you wouldn't have to turn on the light to wake anyone else up. For senior citizens, this reduces accidents since sometimes, they have trouble seeing where they are going.  </p>
