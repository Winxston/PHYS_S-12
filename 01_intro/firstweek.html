  <h3>|PHYS S-12|   Week 1: Introduction </h3> <br> 
        <h4> Day 1: Introduction to Materials and Documentation </h4>
            <p> This was the first day of the summer course. I was really excited to see other people who loved designing, engineering, etc. I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of people who were musicians and artists! At the same time, I was very nervous. We scattered into breakout room for some icebreakers, where we introduced ourselves to a couple of other people. We shared some ideas that we had off the top of our head, giving us a thought for the final proposal. I couldn't really think of any efficient or eco-friendly off the top of my head, so I decided that window blinds controlled by the sunlight seemed pretty sweet. After we left the breakout rooms, we began sharing our ideas to the class. I heard many great ideas, such as RC drones and so on. We were then introduced to GitHub and Sublime Text, programs that we would be using to write HTML for our document websites. We went over basic coding functions and the GitHub layout, and I felt a little more comfortable with coding than before. </p>

        <h4> Day 2: Fusion 360 </h4>
            <p> We began our second class by finally opening our kits. I was very excited to see what was packed inside. Opening the box, I found many bags of hardware and tools, such mobos, LED lights, and a digital caliper. We opened up Bag 8 first, which was full of hardware. We also opened up a box that contained a digital caliper, which would be used measure things prescisely. We were told that for this course, we would be using millimeters mostly. Mr. Hart then showed us how to install the lithium ion battery and operate a caliper. Victoria then showed us around the lab, where we saw a very advanced looking laser cutter. She demonstrated how the laser cutter in the lab functioned and how we could send a file over. We then started downloading Autodesk Fusion 360, a program for 3D design. I had worked with programs like these before in my school. Personally, I am more familiar with Autodesk Inventor, but Fusion 360 has pretty similar mechanics. It is still fun and good to use. We practiced some tutorials in which we cut out a square piece, and tried to assemble it together. Our assignment after the class was to measure and design three separate pieces of hardware, just for practice for designing.  
        
        <h5> 3D Components </h5>
            <p> Looking through the kit, I chose three objects that I wanted to design on Fusion 360. I chose one of the 3D printed pieces (white), one of the Lego Cylinders, and a small metal bearing. They weren't too difficult to create, but I did have to record down the measurements I took from my digital caliper. The end products weren't exactly to scale, but I feel like it was a good representation of the actual pieces.
