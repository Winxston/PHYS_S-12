 		<h4> Day 9: </h4>

        <p> <b>Assignment: Control a board from a local wireless network. Program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet. </b> </p>

        <h5> Controlling LED Light Over the Network </h5>

        <p> I was not able to control the LED over my home WiFi. I had followed all the steps, even trying both of the networks available. </p>

        <h5> Working with Firebase </h5>

        <p> I was more successful with Firebase than my home network. Below is the link to the site that can control the LED light's status.</p>
