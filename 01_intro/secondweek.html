  <h3>|PHYS S-12|   Week 2 </h3> <br> 
 		<h4> Day 3: Basics of Electronics and Microcontrollers </h4>
            <p> Today, we were introduced to a handful of new things. Out of the box that we opened last class, we pulled out a list of things: a Metro MO Microcontroller, a white Breadboard, some wires (red, black, and yellow), a wire stripper, a mulitmeter, a bunch of resistors, a potentiometer, and some LEDs. Looking at the Microcontroller, I was confused about all the small letters and symbols etched into the controller. </p>
            <p> <b>Assignment:</b> Create a circuit using a breadboard and other components. Use a multimeter to measure the voltage of the circuit. Use Ohm's Law to calculate current in the circuit. Also use the Microcontroller Analog to measure the voltage of a potentiometer.</p> 

        <h4> Day 4: Beginnings of Rapid Prototyping </h4>
            <p> As our second week began to wrap up (time passed by way too fast), we were introduced to </p>
            <p> <b>Assignment:</b> Create a kinetic sculpture using circuits and physical components.</p>
