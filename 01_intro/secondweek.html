 		<h4> Day 3: Basics of Electronics and Microcontrollers </h4>

            <p> Today, we were introduced to a handful of new things. Out of the box that we opened last class, we pulled out a list of things: a Metro MO Microcontroller, a white Breadboard, some wires (red, black, and yellow), a wire stripper, a mulitmeter, a bunch of resistors, a potentiometer, and some LEDs. Looking at the Microcontroller, I was confused about all the small letters and symbols etched into the controller. </p>

            <p> <b>Assignment:</b> Create a circuit using a breadboard and other components. Use a multimeter to measure the voltage of the circuit. Use Ohm's Law to calculate current in the circuit. Also use the Microcontroller Analog to measure the voltage of a potentiometer.</p> 

            <p> To start off, I built myself a small circuit consisting of red wires stemming from the 3.3 V pin, black wires connecting to the GRND pin, and two 1K Ohm resistors. I plugged the circuit into the port of my computer. The circuit can be seen below. </p>

            <p> I then took the multimeter, and measured the voltage in the circuit. I put the black cord against the ground wire, and the red cord against the 3.3 V wire, and of course, I received a reading of 3.3 V. However, when I put the red cord between the two resistors, I found that the voltage was cut roughly in half, giving me a reading of 1.64 V. </p>

            <p> I also rebuilt the circuit on Tinkercad to confirm my readings. The Tinkercad circuit is arranged differently, but it still gets the job done. </p>

            <img src="../ohm's_law.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Loop Code">

            <p> Using Ohm's Law, which states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, I can calculate the current of my circuit in front of me. </p>

            <p> In the situation with the resistors, I would be dividing 1.64 V by 1000 (for 1K resistor). That would equal a current of 0.00164 A. </p>

        <h4> Day 4: Beginnings of Rapid Prototyping </h4>

            <p> As our second week began to wrap up (time passed by way too fast), we were introduced to </p>

            <p> <b>Assignment:</b> Create a kinetic sculpture using circuits and physical components.</p>
