    <h1> The Amazing "Automatic Page Turner" (not really) </h1>

    <h2> Demo Video Coming Soon. </h2> <br>

    <h4> What's This All About Anyway? </h4>

    <p> As our classes come to a close, I've come to realize that one of my favorite things that I've worked with this summer are motors. They are the driving forces that bring objects to life, making them look alive. They can accomplish tasks that people are too lazy to do! And with our advancing technology today, you can find any kind of motor almost anywhere. Because of this, I wanted to use motors primarily for my final project.</p>

    <p> 

 		<h4> Final Project Preparation (Work In Progress) </h4>

      <p> After making numerous changes to my final project idea, I finally settled on an idea I had in the back of my head for a while now. It's a page turning machine which consists of stepper motors, servomotors, and the use of the online platform "Firebase". I really like this idea of a final project because it really sounds cool to me. </p>

        <img src="../rough_pageturningmachine_plan.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:125%" alt="Page Turning Machine"> 

      <p> Above is my first rough draft/planning of the page turning machine. To summarize the bad drawing in the picture, I would probably use one DC motor to turn a wheel, which would turn the page inwards, revealing a gap near the center of the book. A stepper motor would then turn clockwise to push that page over to the left side. Then, the whole process repeats. I tried to come up with other methods to turn the page inwards in a way that wouldn't damage or wrinkle the page, and the wheel seemed to be the best idea. </p>

      <p> Before this, I thought about having another "arm" with a rubber end, which would push down and towards the center of the page. I then decided that that method would do the most damage to the pages.</p>

      <img src="../servo_arm_idea.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:125%" alt="Servomotor Arm Idea">

      <p> This kind of arm would be attached with a rubber end, for a better grip on the paper. As I was building my current machine, I realized that having a good grip was important. Through numerous trials, it became evident that without some kind of rubber material, there would be an approximate 70% chance of the arm catching the page. </p>

      <p> One more realization that came to mind as I was planning was that this kind of machine could only work with larger books (i.e. school textbooks). I was thinking that it would be nice if this would work with more common reading material, but for that idea to work, better materials and more time would be required. A machine like this would also need to be pretty compact, small, and strong, since smaller books tend to be harder to keep open due to their bindings.</p>

    <h5> Creating the Foundations </h5>

      <p> The first step to creating my project was to start off with a foundation, or a frame, just like building any house. Where would the book, boards, and motors go? </p>

      <p> I checked around my household and found the most abundant material that I could find: cardboard. It's not always the most reliable, since it can get soggy (and nasty) under humid conditions, and if tampered with, can also bend easily, making it pretty weak. But since I had loads of it, I used it as the foundation, reinforcing it multiple times with around 3 layers stacked on each other. The end product was pretty strong, and I wrapped it with blank white paper to give it a cleaner finish. Honestly, no one likes looking at stale, brown cardboard. If time permits, I might add some nice touch-ups to the project (on the paper), just so it can look cooler. But I'll save that part for last. </p>

      <img src="../cardboard_foundation.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Page Turning Machine">

      <p> The board is around 3/8 inches thick.</p>

    <h5> Creating the First Arm </h5>

      <img src="../arm1.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="First Arm Front">

      <p> Compared to my first rough drawn plan, this arm looks nothing like the one I depicted. It still has the same function of turning the page inwards, but I made a change to the arm. I added a bearing to function as a pivot. I thought this worked nicely. I cut up and added some wooden take out chopsticks to build a frame for the arm, with the DC motor at the front, next to the wheel. With a couple of rubber bands, I tightened the ends of the chopsticks, and along with some gorilla glue, the sticks were fastened tight! As you can see, stuck between the rubber bands are some bolts and nuts, which give the arm some weight. Without enough weight, the page wouldn't catch with the rubber tire. I also cut out some cardboard supports for the arm, which raises the pivot point around 1.5 inches off the platform. That way, the textbook can fit right underneath it. </p>

      <img src="../arm1back.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="First Arm Back">

      <p> This back view just shows how I began to try to manage the wiring. It wasn't too great, and to be frank, wire management sucks. I had to make sure some of the wires weren't touching each other, which would interrupt the circuit. Trying to keep them straight was really a pain. 

    <h5> Creating the Second Arm </h5>

      <img src="../arm2.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Page Turning Machine">  

      <p> The second arm, controlled by a stepper motor, was constructed with, yet again, wooden take out chopsticks. I have nothing against them, as they are actually a really good building material for frames and stuff. You can think of them as budget dowel rods. The second arm stayed more consistent with the drawing, but there was one problem I had to deal with. I couldn't find anything to put on the shaft of the stepper motor. I decided to make a custom attachment for the shaft, which was made of the handy-dandy chopsticks, rubber bands, gorilla glue, and a plastic bracket. </p>

      <p> Now, originally, the plastic bracket didn't fit the shaft of the motor either. I decided to burn a hole into the plastic with a nail that had a similar diameter. I turned on my stove, and held a clamp with the nail over it for about 5 minutes until the nail started smoking. Putting that nail through the plastic was like slicing butter with a hot knife. Anyway, it made a hole just perfect for the shaft. It worked perfectly, too, until the plastic started coming apart, becoming looser and looser to the point where it didn't catch on the shaft anymore. That's when the rubber bands came in to fasten the arm to the motor. </p>

    <h5> Spacing/Positioning </h5>

      <p> As I worked with the foundation, spacing became to present itself as an issue. There were a lot of wires in the way of the arms, so I had to do a bit of wire management. What would be the best, and neatest way, to get this job done? </p>

      <img src="../wire_back.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Wiring Back View">

      <p> Above is an update in which I tried to solve this problem by building small "containers" to house the wires. This solved the majority of my wiring problems, especially for the stepper motor. Before this fix, the stepper motor had a clump of wires right behind it, which interrupted the 360 degree turn occasionally. </p>

      <img src="../fixed_wire_back.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Wire Remanagement">

      <p> Above is another update where I close up the back of the machine, making all the wires disappear. I made small little cutouts in the sides so that the wires still have space to move and can pass easily from one side to another. 

      <img src="../cornerposition.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Corner Positioning">

      <p> This is near the completion of the page turning machine project. Of course, the textbook that I would be using would need a place to be put. A very specific place. So after running through trial and error, I found that the optimal spot to situate the book would be at where a right angle is created. Positioning the top right corner of the book there while open would make it so that almost everytime, the page would turn successfully. Of course, other factors came into play, such as the weight of wheel arm (arm 1) on the page, and for how long the wheel would be turning. </p>

    <h5> Programming </h5>

      <p> I feel that programming this was the longest portion of this project, but it was fun to play around with to make the page turning machine work at its best. </p>

      <p> I utilized Firebase so that I would able to control the turning of the pages digitally. I followed Nathan's tutorial and was able to connect my machine to the database. </p>

    <h5> Ideas for the Future </h5>

      <p> As of right now, I think that having a field on the page where I can type in a number (between 1 and 5), would be extremely cool. That way, the user can also choose how many pages he/she wants turned. Also, it does get boring when the machine has only one function: to turn one page. </p>
