 		<h4> Final Project Preparation </h4>
    <p> After making numerous changes to my final project idea, I finally settled on an idea I had in the back of my head for a while now. It's a page turning machine which consists of stepper motors, servomotors, and the use of Firebase. I really like this idea of a final project because I get to utilize output devices such as motors. Plus, this really sounds cool to me.
