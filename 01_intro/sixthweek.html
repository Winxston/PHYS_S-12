    <h1> The Amazing "Automatic Page Turner" (not really) </h1>

    <h2> Demo Video Coming Soon. </h2> <br>

    <h4> What's This All About Anyway? </h4>

    <p> As our classes come to a close, I've come to realize that one of my favorite things that I've worked with this summer are motors. They are the driving forces that bring objects to life, making them look alive. They can accomplish tasks that people are too lazy to do! And with our advancing technology today, you can find any kind of motor almost anywhere. Because of this, I wanted to use motors primarily for my final project.</p>

    <p> 

 		<h4> Final Project Preparation (Work In Progress) </h4>

      <p> After making numerous changes to my final project idea, I finally settled on an idea I had in the back of my head for a while now. It's a page turning machine which consists of stepper motors, servomotors, and the use of the online platform "Firebase". I really like this idea of a final project because I get to utilize output devices such as motors. Plus, this really sounds cool to me. </p>

      <p> To summarize the bad handwriting in the picture, I would probably use one servomotor to turn a wheel, which would turn the page inwards, revealing a gap near the center of the book. A stepper motor would then turn clockwise to push that page over to the left side. Then, the whole process repeats. I tried to come up with other methods to turn the page inwards in a way that wouldn't damage or wrinkle the page, and the wheel seemed to be the best idea. Before this, I thought about having another "arm" with a rubber end, which would push down and towards the center of the page. I then decided that that method would do the most damage to the pages.</p>

      <p> One more realization that came to mind as I was planning was that this kind of machine could only work with larger books (i.e. school textbooks). I was thinking that it would be nice if this would work with more common reading material, but for that idea to work, better materials and more time would be required. </p>

    <h5> Creating the Foundation </h5>

      <p> The first step to creating my project was to start off with a foundation, or a frame, just like building any house. Where would the book, boards, and motors go? </p>

      <p> I checked around my household and found the most abundant material that I could find: cardboard. It's not always the most reliable, since it can get soggy (and nasty) under humid conditions, and if tampered with, can also bend easily, making it pretty weak. But since I had loads of it, I used it as the foundation, reinforcing it multiple times with around 3 layers. The end product was pretty strong, and I wrapped it with blank white paper to give it a cleaner finish. Honestly, no one likes looking at stale, brown cardboard. If time permits, I might add some nice touch-ups to the project (on the paper), just so it can look cooler. But I'll save that part for last. 

    <h5> Programming </h5>

    <h5> Creating the Second Arm </h5>

      <p>

    <h5> Spacing </h5>

      <p> As I worked with the foundation, spacing became an issue. There were a lot of wires in the way of the arms, so I had to do a bit of wire management. What would be the best, and neatest way, to get this job done?
