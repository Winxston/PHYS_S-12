    <h1> The Amazing "Automatic Page Turner" (not really) </h1>

    <h2> Demo Video Coming Soon. </h2> <br>

 		<h4> Final Project Preparation (Work In Progress) </h4>
    <p> After making numerous changes to my final project idea, I finally settled on an idea I had in the back of my head for a while now. It's a page turning machine which consists of stepper motors, servomotors, and the use of the online platform "Firebase". I really like this idea of a final project because I get to utilize output devices such as motors. Plus, this really sounds cool to me. </p>

    <p> To summarize the bad handwriting in the picture, I would probably use one servomotor to turn a wheel, which would turn the page inwards, revealing a gap near the center of the book. A stepper motor would then turn clockwise to push that page over to the left side. Then, the whole process repeats. I tried to come up with other methods to turn the page inwards in a way that wouldn't damage or wrinkle the page, and the wheel seemed to be the best idea. Before this, I thought about having another "arm" with a rubber end, which would push down and towards the center of the page. I then decided that that method would do the most damage to the pages.</p>

    <p> One more realization that came to mind as I was planning was that this kind of machine could only work with larger books (i.e. school textbooks). I was thinking that it would be nice if this would work with more common reading material, but for that idea to work, better materials and more time would be required. </p>
