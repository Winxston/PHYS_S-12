 		<h4> Day 5: Learning About Programming Electronics with Arduino </h4>
            <p> Today, we learned more about programming with the Arduino program, along with incorporating LED lights and buttons in our circuits. Specifically, we learned about conditional statements and nested conditional statements. These statements allowed the code to run under different conditions or situations. Nested conditional statements, such as millis(), for example, relayed back to us the number of milliseconds since the program had begun.  </p>

            <p> We also were introduced to loops, which would allow us to create fades in the LED lighting.
