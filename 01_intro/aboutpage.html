		<h3> About Me </h3>
			<p style="margin-right: "> Hello! I'm Winston, a rising junior at the Wheatley School in Old Westbury, New York. I'm sixteen, my hobbies are drumming, longboarding, and biking, and in school, I really like chemistry and DDP (a design for production course). In my school, I am part of the robotics club, although I am pretty new to it. In my club, my partner and I were responsible for designing and modeling our team's robot, as well as coming up with ideas for the competition. I've had experience working on platforms such as Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and SketchUp. Unfortunately, I am not much of a coder. I wouldn't be able to code for my life. </p>

			<p> Over this summer, I am determined to learn more about what I would like to pursue in the future. Though I am currently a sophmore, rising junior now, college getting closer and closer. I know that my interests lie in the design/creating field, because that seems like one of the topics that I enjoy the most. I also really love architecture, especially modern architecture. As for this summer course, in which I'm really excited to be in, I am looking forward to create something that assists people, reducing the risks of accidents. I am also looking forward to hopefully learning more about coding and learning something about myself. </p>
