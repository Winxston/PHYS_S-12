	<h3> About Me </h3>
	<p> Hello! I'm Winston, a rising junior at the Wheatley School in Old Westbury, New York. My hobbies are drumming and longboarding, and in school, I really like chemistry and DDP (a beginner's design for production course). In my school, I am part of the robotics club, although I am pretty new to it. In my club, my partner and I were responsible for designing and modeling our team's robot, as well as coming up with ideas for the competition. I've had experience working on platforms such as Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and SketchUp. Unfortunately, I am not much of a coder. For this summer course, I am looking forward to create something that assists people, reducing the risks of accidents. I am also looking forward to learning how to code and learning something about myself. </p>
